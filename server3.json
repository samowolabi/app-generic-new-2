Chopin\u2019s Irish contemporary John Field (1782-1837) was actually the first composer to write a &quot;nocturne&quot; (a work conveying the mood of evening) for piano solo. Chopin modelled his after Field\u2019s.  In the Nocturne in F sharp, Op. 15, No. 2, Chopin begins with a Larghetto melody whose simplicity is rippled with surprising twists of brilliance. The middle section surges with increasing movement and sonority before the languid opening melody returns.","image":"https:\/\/learn.pianoencyclopedia.com\/hydra\/HydraCreator\/live-editor\/modules-assets\/app-the-ultimate-collection-of-piano-music\/img\/big\/013.mid.jpg","type":"interactive-pdf","content":"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/435154346?h=490025c8ee","attachmentType":"","attachmentTitle":"","attachmentUrl":"","parentChapter":1200013,"order":"2"},"1100014":{"title":"How to Play 'To The Spring, Op. 43, No. 6'","subtitle":"Grieg, Edvard","description":"Edvard Grieg\u2019s most characteristic piano writing is found in his many volumes of short works called Lyric Pieces.

It has a Spanish influence, using the spirit of Spanish popular dance forms and is similar in style to a Spanish jota. Domenico Scarlatti (1685-1657) wrote over 500 pieces for the harpsichord. Most of these pieces were adapted from the individual dances of the suite. He published only 30 of these pieces in 1738 in a portfolio called Exercises for Harpsichord (Essercizi per Gravicembalo). The one movement pieces each have the title of Sonata. They were conceived not as mere technical exercises, but real Etudes, in the sense of Chopin\u2019s works of the same name. Although he was Italian born, his harpsichord works were mainly composed in Spain, where Scarlatti spent the latter part of his life under the patronage of Queen Mar\u00b0a B rbara. Each sonata is in one movement with two optionally repeated sections. They often have a single theme but sometimes two or three, and these melodies are concise, clear and strikingly elegant. They often display the Spanish influence, not in the lively dance spirit, but also in the use of note repetition, a characteristic of Spanish guitar music. He imitates the strumming of a guitar with broken chords. He also likes to set his basic melody against a steady rhythm, echoing the tune around the keyboard. Scarlatti also likes to have the melody thrown around in imitation between the two hands. He makes the hands cross and, although he doesn\u2019t use a lot of melodic ornaments, has a special love for trills. Today, these sonatas appear as piano solos, although they truly are conceived for the sound of a harpsichord.

He imitates the strumming of a guitar with broken chords. He also likes to set his basic melody against a steady rhythm, echoing the tune around the keyboard. Scarlatti also likes to have the melody thrown around in imitation between the two hands. He makes the hands cross and, although he doesn\u2019t use a lot of melodic ornaments, has a special love for trills. Today, these sonatas appear as piano solos, although they truly are conceived for the sound of a harpsichord.

Wohltemperiertes Klavier, or Well-Tempered Clavier, was published by Bach in two volumes of 24 Preludes and Fugues each. The first was released in 1722, and the second around 1740. By using all major and minor keys, this collection of works was taking advantage of a new advance in keyboard technology: tempered tuning.
