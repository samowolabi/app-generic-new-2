I have great news for all our followers.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Last week, we had the biggest discount of the year during our Black Friday special,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we got tons of requests asking if we could offer a more affordable payment plan

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
with more installments.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You asked for it, and we are doing it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I am happy to announce that our new payment plan makes The Piano Encyclopedia accessible to everyone.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You can now get lifetime access to all of the piano courses in The Piano Encyclopedia

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
by making 12 very low and affordable installments, which cost less than a single piano class with a private teacher.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
As soon as you complete your order, you will get access to all of the learning materials up front,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so you can start your lessons now and worry about paying later.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You will get all of our interactive piano courses that will teach you how to play your favorite songs, play by ear, improvise,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and even create your own music by understanding how music really works.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You will get everything, including our flagship product, the logic behind music that has been featured on Forbes

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
as the course that is "revolutionizing the way people learn how to play the piano".

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Furthermore, you will get an upgrade to the upcoming Epic 2023 Edition for free,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
which will come with 25,000 multimedia graphics, interactive sheet music, and groundbreaking technology.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And to top it all off, we are also including a very rare and incredibly valuable bonus.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.000
A year long, one-to-one mentorship with one of our expert musicians who will personally help you reach all of your musical goals.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Sounds incredible? It is, but there is a catch!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This is the best offer of the year, so it won't last long.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It's available until this Wednesday, December 7th, or until we reach the first 250 customers, whichever comes first.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So if you've been waiting all year long to join The Piano Encyclopedia, now it's the time.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
