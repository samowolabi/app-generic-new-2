How do they work?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cThe damper pedal, sustain pedal, or sustaining pedal are many names for the same pedal. They are synonyms. It is the pedal to the right of the other two, and it is the one that is used more often.<br><br>How does it work? It raises all the dampers off the strings so that they keep vibrating after the player releases the key.  <br><br>The damper pedal lets the pianist sustain notes which would otherwise be out of reach, for instance, in accompanying chords and accomplish legato passages (smoothly connected notes), which would have no possible fingering otherwise.<br><br>\n\nHowever, the damper pedal is not just used for legato purposes; it is also used for \"colouring.\" Depressing the sustain pedal causes all the strings to vibrate sympathetically with whichever notes are being played, which greatly enriches the piano's tone, creating an overall change in the \"colour\" of the piano sound.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>Legato passages and the pedal<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Could you explain to me what does playing \"legato\"  mean. and if it is related to the usage of the sustain pedal?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cLet me explain. The word legato literally means \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201cbound together.\u201d Playing legato means transitioning from note to note with no intervening silence. Or almost no silence - as smoothly as possible.<br><br>\nThe pedal is of great use when joining two otherwise unconnected notes or chords together, that cannot be connected in any other way.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>The use of the pedal for colouring<\/h2>\n\t<h3>What is the real use of the sustain pedal?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cPrimarily it serves to prolong such tones as we cannot hold with the fingers. But it is also one of the greatest means for colouring. <br><br>The employment of it should always be governed by the ear.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>How to use the sustain pedal<\/h2>\n\t<h3>When is it too much pedaling? When is it too little? <\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cTo answer the question, you must remember that the sustain pedal has two principal purposes:\n<br><br>\n1. Allowing the sound to continue even after we release the keys\n        <br>\n        2. Changing the timbre of the sound, making it deeper, warmer, more intense, more \u2018alive\u2019.\n        <br><br>Avoid the use of the pedal completely and it will be difficult to bring enough emotion to your music. Arthur Rubinstein once said: <i>\u201cThe more I play, the more I am convinced the pedal is the soul of the pianoforte!\u201d<\/i>.\n<br><br>\nDo not make this mistake of leaving the pedal on while the harmony changes. This will create a muddy sound. <i>\u201cAbusing the pedal is only a means of covering up a lack of technique\u201d<\/i> - Claude Debussy\n<br><br>\nWhen to use it? You'll want to change the pedal when harmonies change. As soon as the harmonies change, release the pedal; and then push it back down. This will produce a clean sound instead of a muddy one.\n<br><br>\nIn order to understand if the harmonies change or not, on any particular piece, you need to have an understanding of how music works. How chords and scales are related; and how they affect the harmony of a piece. Also, if your desire is to learn how to improvise, compose, and play by ear - then studying the logic behind music is a must.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><!--<div style=\"padding: 30px; background: yellow;\">\n\tAdvertisement\n<\/div>-->",

You can push the pedal down, slightly. This is called half-pedalling (not pushing the pedal all the way down). <br><br>When you partially press down the sustain pedal the dampers touch the strings very slightly. This allows a subtle variation of the sound quality that creates a rich tone. It is usually considered an advanced technique that can enhance the sound of particular notes you are playing by using different amounts of pedal. I suggest you to experiment with it to enrich your playing and enhance musical expression.\u201d<br><br>An example of a musical piece that is played with half-pedaling by some pianists is Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Most recent digital pianos also support this effect.<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>How to use the pedal<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Please tell me how to use the pedal. I find that in some pieces there is no mark under the measures to show me when it should be used. Is there any rule which you can give me?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cAssuming that you have in mind the artistic use of the pedal, I regret to say that there is no more a rule for this than for the mixing of colours upon the palette of a painter who strives for some particular shade or tint. He knows that blue and yellow make green, that red and blue make purple; but those are ground colours which he can rarely use. <br><br>For the finer shades he has to experiment, to consult his eye and his judgment. The relation between the pedal and the player's ear is exactly similar to that of the palette and the painter's eye. Generally speaking (from sad experience) it is far more important to know when not to use the pedal than when to use it. We must refrain from its use whenever there is the slightest danger of unintentional mingling of tones. This is best avoided by taking the pedal after striking the tone upon which it is to act, and to release it promptly and simultaneously with the striking of the next tone. It may be at once taken again, and this alternation must be kept up where there is either a change of harmony or a succession of \"passing notes.\" <br><br>This is the only positive rule I can give, but even this is often violated. Let your ear be the guardian of your right foot. Accustom your ear to harmonic and melodic clarity, and\u2014listen closely. To teach the use of the pedal independent of the action of your own ear is impossible.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>A general rule about the pedal<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Should I use the pedal with each melody note? Should like a general rule.<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cThe treading upon the pedal should always follow immediately after the striking of the note for which it is intended, or else there will be discords arising from the mingling of that note with the one preceding it. This is the general rule. Exceptions there are, of course, but they occur only in certain moments when a mingling of tones is purposed for some special effect.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>Let your ear guide your pedalling<\/h2>\n\t<h3>In Weber's \"Storm\"  should the pedal be held down throughout the entire piece, as directed? It produces quite a discord.<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cWithout knowing this piece, even by name, I may say that the pianos of Weber's time had a tone of such short duration and volume that the discords resulting from a continuous use of the pedal were not so noticeable, as they are now upon the modern piano with its magnificent volume and duration of tone. Hence, the pedal must now be used with the utmost caution. <br><br>Generally speaking, I say\u2014again\u2014that the ear is the \"sole\" guide of the foot upon the pedal.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>Use pedal with caution in playing Bach<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Is Bach's music ever played with the pedal?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cThere is no piano-music that forbids in playing the use of the pedal. Even where the texture of a piece does not require the pedal\u2014which happens very rarely\u2014the player might employ it as an aid where the reach of his hand proves insufficient to hold all the parts of a harmony together. With Bach the pedal is often very important; for, by judicious use\u2014as, for instance, in the cases of organ-point\u2014it accumulates harmonic tones, holds the fundamental tone and thus produces effects not dissimilar to the organ. <br><br>Qualitatively speaking, the pedal is as necessary in Bach's music  as in any other; quantitatively, I recommend the utmost caution in its use, so as not to blur the fine texture of his polyphony.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><!--<div style=\"padding: 30px; background: yellow;\">\n\tAdvertisement\n<\/div>-->",

On older pianos, there used to be just two strings for each of the notes. When pressing the \"una-corda\" pedal,  the whole piano mechanism, including the keyboard, slightly shifted to the right. This would move the hammers over so they would only strike one of the strings instead of the two, producing a softer sound.\n<br><br>\nNewer pianos have three strings for each note for most notes of the keyboard, but the mechanism is the same. The result is not just a decrease in volume (dynamics), but also,  it modifies and softens its tone quality.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>Soft pedal: grand vs upright piano<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Does the soft pedal produce the same effect on a grand piano and an upright piano? I played on a grand piano and the soft pedal seems to have a different effect than the one on my upright piano.<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cThe short answer is: no. On a grand piano, the soft pedal reduces volume (dynamics) and also changes the tone quality by producing a mellower sound. On the contrary, on an upright piano, the soft pedal merely reduces the volume.\n<br><br>\nTrue \"una-corda\" or soft-pedals only exist on grand pianos. On upright pianos, the soft pedal operates a mechanism that moves the hammers' resting position closer to the strings. Since the hammers have less distance to travel, this reduces the speed at which they hit the strings, and hence the volume is reduced, but this does not change tone quality in the way the \"una-corda\" pedal does on a grand piano.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>When to use the soft pedal? An expressive device<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Could you please explain me when should I use the soft pedal? Is it just about dynamics?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cThe soft pedal is not just about dynamics. It is about a change in color in the piano sound.\n<br><br>\nThe soft pedal is said to produce a soft and ethereal tone. You should use it to add variety to your playing and use it on particular music sections. For example, when you play the repetition of a theme, you may play it using the soft pedal to create a new and different sound. It's a wonderful way to highlight certain sections of your music.\n\n<br><br>When appropriately used, the soft pedal is an extraordinarily expressive device that can add new color and depth to your music.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>Do not over-use the soft pedal<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Should the \"Gavotte in A\" of Gluck-Brahms be played without the soft pedal? Does a liberal use of the soft pedal tend to make the student lazy in using a light touch?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cYour first question is too general, as there is no piece of music that should be played entirely with or without the soft pedal; it is used only when a certain change of colouring is proposed. A too frequent use of the soft pedal does tend to a neglect of the pianissimo touch, and it should, therefore, be discouraged.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><!--<div style=\"padding: 30px; background: yellow;\">\n\tAdvertisement\n<\/div>-->",

It should therefore never be used to hide a faulty piano (or soft) touch. Mere softness of tone should always be produced by a decrease of finger-force and a lessening of the raising of the fingers.

If the player's technique is too insufficient for this the deciphering must, of course, be done for each hand separately.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>Mastering a piece: practising the two parts separately<\/h2>\n\t<h3>In order to master the performance of a composition, should the hands practise their parts separately?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cIf this is not the first time you are reading the piece, and provided you have formed a general idea of the piece, it is well to practise the hands separately, because you can, in this way, concentrate your attention upon the work of each hand. As soon, however, as each hand knows its work the hands should play together in order now to pursue the musical purpose for which the separate practice was only a technical preparation.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>Time to devote to technical exercises<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Should I practise studies in general for my progress or should I confine myself strictly to my technical exercises?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cYour strictly technical exercises should occupy one-quarter of the entire time you can give to your work. Two quarters you should use for the technical preparation of the difficult passages you encounter in the pieces you are studying, and during the last quarter these passages which have been thus prepared should be ranged into their proper places in the pieces, in order that you may not lose your view of the totality of the pieces while studying or practising details.<br><br>\nApart from pure practice, it is vital that you develop a solid understanding of how music works from the very beginning. Technique will take you nowhere if you are not able to understand how chords, scales, and intervals relate to each other. Your understanding of music should be enough so that you are able to identify the underlying patterns behind the pieces you are playing.\u201d <\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>Do not rise the piano's stool too high<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Are the best results at the piano attained by sitting high or low?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cAs a general rule, I do not recommend a high seat at the piano, because this induces the employment of the arm and shoulders rather than of the fingers, and is, of course, very harmful to the technique. As to the exact height of the seat, you will have to experiment for yourself and find out at which height you can play longest with the least fatigue.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>The only kind of practice worth while<\/h2>\n\t<h3>In purely technical, i.e., mechanical, practice may I have a book or a magazine on the music-stand and read?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cThis question will appear grotesque to anyone who has not thought of it, yet it is legitimate; for I know positively that this crime upon themselves has been committed by many. I cannot warn students too strongly against this pernicious habit. It is far better to practise only half as long, but with concentrated attention. Even purely mechanical matter must be transmitted to the motor-centres of the brain through the agencies of the ear and eye in order to bring beneficial technical results. <br><br>If the brain is otherwise occupied it becomes insensible to the impression of the work in hand, and practise thus done is a complete waste of time. Not only should we not read, but also not think of anything else but the work before us, if we expect results. Concentration is the first letter in the alphabet of success.<br><br>Also, you must remember: all of the greatest pianists of history were also composers. It is crucial that you understand the logic behind music to be able to master the piano. This will be your only path to not just becoming great at this instrument, but also, to develop the skills of improvisation, composition, and playing by ear.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><!--<div style=\"padding: 30px; background: yellow;\">\n\tAdvertisement\n<\/div>-->",

Handle the piano lightly while the hands are cold, and increase both force and speed only when the hands have gained their normal temperature and elasticity. This may take half or even three-quarters of an hour.

After that, however, I consider the practising of scales important, not only for the fingers, but also for the discipline of the ear with regard to the feeling of tonality (key), understanding of intervals, and the comprehension of the total compass of the piano.\u201d<br><br>Scales are not just about technique; understanding the relationship between scales and chords is what will let you improvise, compose, and play by ear. You will be able to learn more about these concepts in The Piano Encyclopedia's Digital Home-Study Course \"The Logic Behind Music\".<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>The morning practice on the piano for a concert pianist<\/h2>\n\t<h3>In resuming my studies in the morning what should I play first?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cIf you are looking forward to become a concert pianist this is what I recommend. Begin with your technical work. Scales in all tonalities, each at least twice well rendered. First slowly, one after another, then somewhat quicker, but never very quickly as long as you are not absolutely sure that both hands are perfectly even, and that neither false notes nor wrong fingerings occur.<br><br>To play the scales wrong is just as much a matter of habit as to play them right\u2014only easier. You can get very firmly settled in the habit of striking a certain note wrong every time it occurs unless you take the trouble of counteracting the formation of such a habit.<br><br>After these scales play them in octaves from the wrist, slowly and without tiring it by lifting the hand to a needless height. After this play either Czerny  or Cramer, then Bach, and finally Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, and so on. If you have the time to do it, play one hour in the morning on technical studies and use one hour for the difficult places in the works you are studying. In the afternoon play another hour, and this hour you devote to interpretation.<br><br>I mean by this that you should now apply \u00e6sthetically what you have technically gained in the morning by uniting your mechanical advantages with the ideal conception which you have formed in your mind of the work you are studying.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>Four ways to study a piano piece<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Should a composition be studied away from the piano?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cThere are four ways to study a composition:<br><br> 1. On the piano with the music. <br>2. Away from the piano with the music. <br>3. On the piano without the music. <br>4. Away from the piano without the music <br><br>Two (2) and four (4) are mentally the most taxing and fatiguing ways, no doubt; but they also serve best to develop the memory and what we mean by \"scope,\" which is a faculty of great importance.\u201d\n<br><br>\nThe Piano Encyclopedia has been featured on Forbes as the company that is \"revolutionizing the way people learn to play the piano\". With students in over 75 countries, thousands of testimonials, and over 250,000 raving fans on Facebook, you can guarantee yourself that you will be using a tested and proven curriculum that will help you achieve your goals.

Some exhaust their power of concentration quicker than others; but, however long it may have lasted, once it is exhausted all further work is like unrolling a scroll which we have laboriously rolled up. Practise self-examination, and if you notice that your interest is waning\u2014stop. Remember that in studying the matter of quantity is of moment only when coupled with quality. Attention, concentration, devotion, will make unnecessary any inquiries as to how much you ought to practise.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><!--<div style=\"padding: 30px; background: yellow;\">\n\tAdvertisement\n<\/div>-->",

The Piano Encyclopedia&rsquo;s highly-trained staff of expert musicians has made a tremendous and elaborated investigation, digging up lost historical sources and combining them with modern expert knowledge, to provide you with the ultimate answers to every piano question. <\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>The best way to work up a quick tempo<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Is it ever a waste of time to practise a piece over and over again for months as slowly as a beginner and with utmost concentration? After having done so and gradually working up a tempo, I then find I cannot play so fast as I want to. Is it not wise to begin all over again as slowly as possible? I prefer to work this way, but have been told that one gets \"stale,\" studying the same music for a long time. Do you advise practising with or without the pedal?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cSlow practice is undoubtedly the basis for quick playing; but quick playing is not an immediate result of slow practice. Quick playing must be tried from time to time, with increasing frequency and heightened speed, even at a temporary loss of clearness. <br><br>This loss is easily regained by subsequent returns to slow practice. After all, we must first learn to think quickly through the course of a piece before we can play it quickly, and this mental endeavour, too, will be greatly aided by occasional trials in a quicker tempo. As for getting \"stale,\" a variety of pieces is necessary to preserve the freshness of each one. <br><br>Regarding the pedal, I suggest that you use it judiciously from the very beginning of the study of a new piece; though never in finger exercises.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>The student who cannot play fast music<\/h2>\n\t<h3>I find great difficulty in playing anything that goes quick, though in a more moderate tempo I can play my pieces faultlessly. Every teacher I had promised to develop my speed, but they all failed. Can you give me a hint how to overcome my difficulty?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cQuickness of action, of motion, even of resolution, cannot be acquired by training alone; it must partly be inborn. I assume that your piano-playing is one phase of a general slowness. There is but one remedy for that. You have relied upon your teachers to develop your speed\u2014you should have relied upon your own will-power. Try to will it and to will it often; you will see the ability keep step with the exertions of your will.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>Quick tempo: watch your breathing<\/h2>\n\t<h3>What is the purpose of associating breathing with piano playing, and to what extent should it be practised?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cBreathing is as important in piano playing as in all physical exertion, and more so when we speak of pieces that entail the use of great muscular force; for this causes a quickening in the action of the heart; respiration naturally keeps step with it, and the result is often a forcible breathing through the mouth.<br><br>Players resort to open-mouth breathing in such cases because they cannot help themselves. If, at the last spurt of a bicycle race, we should call to the wheelmen, \"Breathe through the nose!\" we could not wonder if our advice remains unheeded. This open-mouth breathing, however, need not be learned; it is the self-help of nature. <br><br>I recommend breathing through the nose as long as possible. It is more wholesome than mouth-breathing, and it refreshes the head more. When physical exertion becomes too great then you will neither need nor heed my advice or anybody's; your nature will find its own line of least resistance.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>Counting out loud<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Is counting aloud injurious to a pupil's playing\u2014that is, does not the sound of the voice confuse the pupil in getting the correct tone of the note struck?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cLoud counting can hardly ever be injurious\u2014especially not while the pupil is dealing with time and rhythm. This part mastered or fully understood, the audible counting may be lessened and finally abandoned. During practice loud counting is of inestimable value, for it develops and strengthens rhythmic feeling better than anything else will, and, besides, it is an infallible guide to find the points of stress in a phrase.\u201d<br><br><\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>The value and correct practice of phrasing<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Can you give an amateur a concise definition of phrasing and a few helpful suggestions as to clear phrasing?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cPhrasing is a rational division and subdivision of musical sentences, and serves to make them intelligible. It corresponds closely with punctuation in literature and its recitation. Find out the start, the end, and the culminating point of your phrase. The last-named is usually to be found upon the highest note of the phrase, while the former are usually indicated by phrasing slurs. <br><br>Generally speaking, the rising of the melody is combined with an increase of strength up to the point of culmination, where, in keeping with the note design, the decrease of strength sets in. For artistic phrasing it is of the utmost importance properly to recognize the principal mood of the piece, for this must, naturally, influence the rendition of every detail in it. A phrase occurring in an agitated movement, for instance, will have to be rendered very differently from a similar-looking phrase in a slow, dreamy movement.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><!--<div style=\"padding: 30px; background: yellow;\">\n\tAdvertisement\n<\/div>-->",

Basically, sight-reading is reading a piece you haven't seen before and playing it on the spot without any preparation.\u201d<br><br>\nStudio musicians often record pieces on the first take without having seen them before. The expense of the studio, musicians, and techs makes sight-reading skills essential. Typically, a studio performance is \"rehearsed\" only once to check for copying errors before recording the final track. Many professional big bands also sight-read every live performance.<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>How to practice sight-reading<\/h2>\n\t<h3>What is a good plan to pursue to improve the facility in sight-reading?<\/h3>\n\t<p>Practice looking ahead on your sheet music, and reading at least a few notes in advance.\n<br><br>\nMuch reading and playing at sight and as fast as possible, even though at first some slight inaccuracies may creep in. By quick reading you develop that faculty of the eye which is meant by \"grasp,\" and this, in turn, facilitates your reading of details.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>The best way to improve sight-reading<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Is there any practical method that will assist one to greater rapidity in sight-reading?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cThe best way to become a quick reader is first to be able to recognize hidden musical patterns; and second, to read as much as possible. <br><br> There are multiple levels in being able to recognize hidden musical patterns. The first level is being able to recognize chords and scales formed by the melody, which may appear in fragments. The second level is being able to recognize chord progressions, and different type of non-chord notes associated with their different harmonic functions (passing tones, anticipation, neighbor tone, escape tone, suspension, retardation, appoggiaturas, etc). The third level is being able to recognize the structure and form of the pieces. <br><br> The rapidity of your progress depends upon the state of your general musical education, for the more complete this is the better you will be able to surmise the logical sequel of a phrase once started. A large part of sight-reading consists of surmising, as you will find upon analyzing your book-reading.\u201d<br><br>\nHofmann\u2019s answer was expanded with concepts from The Piano Encyclopedia\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/pianoencyclopedia.com\/en\/piano-courses\/the-logic-behind-music\/?ref=members-area-article\">Digital Home-Study Course: \u201cThe Logic Behind Music\u201d<\/a>. Just practicing reading sheet music again and again will not make your sight-reading skills grow. You need to practice intelligently and invest your time wisely. Hofmann was not just a pianist; he was also a composer and had a deep understanding of how music worked. Sight-reading is a skill that you will be able to develop once you have a deep understanding of music and are able to recognize its hidden patterns. <\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>The problem of transposing at sight<\/h2>\n\t<h3>What, please, is the quickest and safest way of transposing from one key to another? I have trouble, for instance, in playing for singing if the piece is in \u201cA major\u201d and the singer wants it in \u201cF major\u201d.<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cThe question of transposing hinges on the process of hearing through the eye. I mean by this that you must study the piece until you learn to conceive the printed music as sounds and sound groups, not as key pictures. Then transfer the sound picture to another tonality in your mind, very much as if when moving from one floor to another with all your household goods you were to place them on the new floor as they were placed on the old. <br><br>Practice will, of course, facilitate this process very much. Transposition at sight is based on somewhat different principles. Here you have to get mentally settled in the new tonality, and then follow the course of intervals. <br><br>If you find transposition difficult you may derive consolation from the thought that it is difficult for everybody, and that transposing at sight is, of course, still more difficult than to transpose after studying the piece beforehand.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><!--<div style=\"padding: 30px; background: yellow;\">\n\tAdvertisement\n<\/div>-->",

Then go over such places as appeared to you especially complex until you understand their construction. Now let the piece rest for a whole day and try to trace in your mind the train of thoughts in the piece. Should you come to a dead stop be satisfied with what you have achieved. Your mind will keep on working, subconsciously, as over a puzzle, always trying to find the continuation.<br><br> If you find that the memory is a blank take the music in hand, look at the particular place\u2014but only at this\u2014and, since you have now found the connection, continue the work of mental tracing. At the next stop repeat this procedure until you have reached the end, not in every detail, but in large outlines. Of course, this does not mean that you can now play it from memory. You have only arrived at the point of transition from the imagined to the real, and now begins a new kind of study: to transfer to the instrument what you have mentally absorbed. Try to do this piece by piece, and look into the printed sheets (which should not be on the music-rack but away from it) only when your memory absolutely refuses to go on. <br><br>The real work with the printed music should be reserved to the last, and you should regard it in the light of a proof-reading of your mental impressions. The whole process of absorbing a piece of music mentally resembles that of photographing. The development of the acoustic picture (the tone-picture) is like the bath. The tentative playing is like the process of \"fixing\" against sensitiveness to lights; and the final work with the printed music is the retouching.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>Playing from memory is indispensable<\/h2>\n\t<h3>Is memorization absolutely essential to a good player?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cPlaying from memory is indispensable to the freedom of rendition. You have to bear in your mind and memory the whole piece in order to attend properly to its details. Some renowned players who take the printed sheets before them on the stage play, nevertheless, from memory. They take the music with them only to heighten their feeling of security and to counteract a lack of confidence in their memory\u2014a species of nervousness.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div>\n\t<h2>To keep errors from creeping in<\/h2>\n\t<h3>I can always memorize a piece before I can play it fast. Do you advise practising with notes when I already know it by heart?<\/h3>\n\t<p>\u201cYou should always practice reading the sheet music many times until you are sure you are playing the correct notes. The occasional playing of a memorized piece from the notes will keep errors from creeping in, provided you read the music correctly and carefully.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><!--<div style=\"padding: 30px; background: yellow;\">\n\tAdvertisement\n<\/div>-->",

The size of the keyboard depends on how many octaves it encompasses. Through a captivating demonstration, we illustrate that regardless of the size, the notes remain the same, and what changes within each octave is the pitch.<br><br>This means that you can play the exact same thing on any part of the keyboard, and it will sound the same, albeit with different pitch. Understanding this fundamental concept reveals that there is little difference in playing a larger or smaller keyboard. Once you master one size, you can effortlessly transition to playing any other, including full-size pianos.<br><br>We go even further to demystify the grand piano, often perceived as more challenging due to its larger size and additional keys. However, upon closer examination, we discover that the extra keys are simply parts of incomplete octaves added to increase the instrument's pitch range. In fact, these additional keys make the grand piano one of the instruments with the widest pitch range in existence, offering pianists endless possibilities for creativity.<br><br>Join us in this eye-opening video as we debunk the myth of differences between small electronic keyboards and full-size keyboards or pianos.

            "subtitle": "Beethoven, Ludwig Van",
            "description": "In 1802, Beethoven's Sonatina Quasi una Fantasia was published under the subtitle Moonlight. Beethoven's publishers were prompted to dub the sonata &quot;Moonlight&quot; by Heinrich Rellstab, who wrote that the first movement inspired the vision &quot;of a boat on Lake Lucerne by a luminous night.&quot; The Moonlight Sonata in C sharp minor, Op. 27, was dedicated to one of Beethoven's many loves: the Countess Giulietta Guicciardi. Upon hearing the Moonlight Sonata, the listener is repeatedly reminded of Beethoven's remarkable emotive humanity. By beginning the Moonlight Sonata with a movement played Adagio sostenuto, Beethoven broke with traditional sonata form. Expessively lyric, this first movement is written in slow, melodic, eighth-note triplets, giving the piece a tranquil sadness.",
